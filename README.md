# BudgetKita (MAD Final Project)

BudgetKita is a mobile app for budget tracking that calculates expense, income, and profit. The goal of this project is to provide and implement a potential mobile application to improve the current system. This project will be developed utilizing a mobile application because it is easier for small business owners to use than a web-based application.

This application will primarily aim to improve overall business efficiency. The majority of small businesses still utilize the traditional approach, such as entering it in an accounting book. This method is not secure because the information is exposed to human error, such as the book being misplaced or lost. Furthermore, calculating profit and loss can be time intensive. As a result, small business owners want a suitable computerized programme to assist them in managing their operations.

Database Used: Firebase was used in our project which provides cloud-based infrastructure for testing Android apps and features full integration with Android Studio for running tests. Firebase includes authentication, realtime database and cloud firestore . It supplies the mobile application with latest data and updates everytime data is updated. Other than that, the firebase has real-time syncing with the android device.
